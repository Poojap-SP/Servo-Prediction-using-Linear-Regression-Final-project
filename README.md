Servo Prediction using Linear Regression

Get Understanding about Data Set What is Servo : In control enginerring a servomechanism, usally shortened to servo, is an automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the action of a mechanism. On displacement-controlled applications, it usally includes a built-in error or other position feedback mechanism to ensure the output is achieving the desired effect. The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signalshelp control mechanical position, speed, attitude or any other measurable varables. for example, an automative power window control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position- the operator does this by observation.By contrast a car's cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism. A data frame with 167 observation on 5variables, 4 nominal and 1 as the target class. This data set is from a simulation of a servo system involving a servo amplifier, a motor, a lead screw/nut, and a sliding carriage of some sort. it may have been on of the translation axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the AI lab. In any case, the output, value is almost certainly a rise time, or the time required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set point. The variables that describe the data set and their values are the following:

Motor A,B,C,D,E

Screw A,B,C,D,E

Pgain 3,4,5,6

Vgain 1,2,3,4,5

Class 0.13 to 7.10
